% Print the name and ID at the beginning
print_achyuth_id :-

% Base case: To move 0 disks, do nothing

% Recursive case: Move N disks from Source to Destination using Auxiliary peg
hanoi(N, Source, Destination, Auxiliary) :-
    print_achyuth_id,  % Print your ID at the start of the solution
    N > 0,
    M is N - 1,  % Move N-1 disks first
    hanoi(M, Source, Auxiliary, Destination),  % Move N-1 disks from Source to Auxiliary
    move_disk(N, Source, Destination),  % Move the N-th disk from Source to Destination
    hanoi(M, Auxiliary, Destination, Source).  % Move N-1 disks from Auxiliary to Destination

% Rule to print the move of a disk
